# JasperReports Shadow Jar

This project was created to show to my students the use of JasperReports Inside a Uber/Shadow Jar.

It is a JavaFx project where you can press a button, see the progress on a progress bar, and at the end a pdf file will be opened automatically.

I used gradle to automate project run and distribution.

# Running

After clone you can use eclipse, intellij or any other IDE ( or editor ), to access project folder and type `./gradlew run`, all dependencies will be handled by gradle, and the project window will be opened.
